# Project Tracker

A simple implementaion of a project tracking application that allows a company to track and measure progress toward a goal.

# Technology

This project uses NextJS for frontend interactivity and Django for a backend api that can serve data and handle data requests 
from the frontend. The NextJS application is built with TypeScript and uses the app router for navigation. For the backend I chose
to use Django because of the simplicity and support that it has for creating a web application quickly.
