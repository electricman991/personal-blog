# Package Tracker

Package Tracker is a backend API service that receives a request from a truck with its location data and then stores that location in a database.

This application was made with Erlang and the cowboy framework to accept incoming / outgoing http requests. The database that was used for this project is Riak which is a key value store. 


# API Endpoints

## location_update
The location update enpoint will first take in a location request with (lat, long) cordinates and then save the new location to the database. This is achieved
by first receiving the data then sending that data to a backend function that will then call the database and store the needed data. 

## location_request
Location request works by providing a package_id that you want the location for and then returning the (lat, long) cordinates to the person who requested the location.
We can achieve this with a database lookup for the location and then return the current location that is stored for the package_id.

## package_transfered
The package transfered endpoint will handle when a package is transfered to a new facility or to a delivery truck for transportation. This will only be used when
transferring a package so that a location_id can be also tracked for the package.

## delivered
Marks the package as delivered. Once the package has reached the final end destination mark the package as "delivered".
